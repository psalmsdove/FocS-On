# FocS-On
A timer-focusing app for iOS

# Welcome to Focs On!

Focs On is an app -**developed with only SwiftUI**- to help you focus on your work or job. You can use classic Pomodoro timing or 
you can use our suggested settings which is 90 minutes study, 25 minutes break.


# About App
For now, it only has the countdown function. You can set the timer as you wish and when it's finished - boom! 
I will add more functionalities as soon as possible and keep the app updated with new features.

# Languages
Currently it is just English, but you can translate the app into any language.
