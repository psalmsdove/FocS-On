# Welcome to Focs On!

Focs On is an app to help you focus on your work or job. You can use classic Pomodoro timing or 
you can use our suggested settings which is 90 minutes study, 25 minutes break.


# About App
For now, it only has the countdown function. You can set the timer as you wish and when it's finished - boom! 
I will add more functionalities as soon as possible and keep the app updated with new features.

# Languages
Currently it is just English, but you can translate the app into any language.
